###Bacteria encapsulation
Genetic transformation is the process by which bacteria incorporates exogenous genetic material directly into its own genome.
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is the transfer of genes between organisms.  
HGT is important in evolution of bacteria allowing rapid alterations in its genome including transfer of  antobiotic resistance.
It has been observed that HGT in vivo takes up significantly more genetic material than reported in vitro lab studies.

###Algae Encapsulation
Algae has been used as a model of the emergence of multicellularity as well as for industral production, and environmental effects including absorbing or releasing toxins. Dissolved gas environments can be used to study the effect on the algae proliferation rate.
