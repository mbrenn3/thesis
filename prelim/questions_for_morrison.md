##questions

1. Bio-films seem to be the ideal environment for large scale HGT. Are we in anyway simulating biofilms? 

* markx et al. HGT in biofilms


2. Could we suggest that we are making a the smallest polyclonal unit?

* yes let's run with that

3. Should we be worried about effects of droplet encapsulation on competence? Starvation, cell density?

* make various combinations of DNA
* strepomyocine sensitive cells
* DNA resistance


4. The concentration of donor DNA seems to effect the frequency of recombination events - fraction of cell with rebicobint chromosome


5. What methods will we use to analyze the genome? Multilocus sequence typing (MLST)? 
* whole genome sequencing typing 


6. Can we go over the dilution and plating plan for the recovered culture?
* cell has 4 copies

7. What specific information should I include about the attacker and victim strains/serotypes and characteristics, (virulence (polysaccharide encapsulated?), antibiotic resistance)?

8. **For the attacker strain, it being unable to produce or secrete CPS making it unable to be competent. Is that a safty mechanism, or is it to preserving/sustaining the strain for cultureing?**
9. peptide vs polysacciride
10. what does making it without polysacciride do? virluence? 
11. Any significance to the specific antibiotic resistances?

Don't know how much will transfer in a single event - 

grow culture - at specific time population adapts behavior
1995 peptide - hoverstien et al. heptadecapeptide.
original 1928
hotchkist tomasz 1964/5 

what's the signal? the peptide
is released by the culture, secretion enzyme, and receptor

#Questions 2
1. What is the reproduction rate of pnemoccus? Can we be confindent that only one event happens with timeing and cooling and dilution of CSP?
2. Figures or info on organization of DNA intake protiens
3.
