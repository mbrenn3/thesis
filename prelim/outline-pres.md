### bio Background
-
Horizontal gene transfer covers transfer of genes other than traditional reproduction.
transformation, transduction(injection by bacteriaphage) or conjugation(direct cell to cell)
Homologous recombination (HR) replacement with corresponding genes from a donor
SNPs or insertion and/or deletion of entire genes and operons.
hundreds to hundreds of thousands of bases
primary cause of transfer of antibiotic resistance and virulence
-
How specificly does uptake of DNA happen [Croucher]
-
cell takes up / scavanges genetic material from enviornment
attacker strains
-
S. pneumoniae a gram-positive bacterium commonly referred to
as pneumococcus
pneumococcus has been observed to undergo high rates of HGT through active uptake of environmental DNA (exogenous DNAs)
serotypes may have different competances
-

### Motovation/significance
-
HTG in vivo results in large transfers of genes compared in what has been observed in the lab.
-
In vivo environment are hard to simulate.
Proximity and confinment may play a role in the amount of genetic material taken up
-

### Aim


isolate two cells in a confined area to determine what happens in a single gene transfer

-

### Tango device design

Tango images

### preliminary results

droplet genorator videos
beads in droplets

### approach

Fluorescent expressing GFP and RFP pnunococci will be used[Kjos]
get strain info from morrison

-
After icubation droplets will be pumped out of the device and  de-emulfied to release the culture into contious media phase.
the culture will be diluted to
